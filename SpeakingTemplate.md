###### Tips and Tricks
- Avoid Repeating Words. Vary your vocabulary as much as possible.
- Use discourse phrases like "as a result," "consequently," "moreover," and “therefore" to link ideas.
- Use a mix of simple and compound sentences.
- Don’t directly copy the prompt.
- Avoid using idioms. They just lead to trouble.
- Don’t use a transition like "I feel this way for two reasons."  That might waste time.
