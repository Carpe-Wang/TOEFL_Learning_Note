> The one commodity that is most valuable on this earth is time. Time to love. Time to live. From the moment the human body is born it begins dying. Some happen faster, some happen slower. Some of us help them go faster, and some of them prevent it from happening soon than later. How many seconds, how many minutes do we waste from our daily life to do things that are nowhere near the goals and aspiration and passion that we have inside. We are living and achieving our dreams. Find time to better ourselves. Read, explore, research, live life do something. That’s what it’s all about.
